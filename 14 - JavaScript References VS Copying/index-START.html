    // 5. however what happens when we update that array?

    // 6. now here is the problem!

    // 7. oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // 8. Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // 9. So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // 10. one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    team2[2] ='Not Bruno';
    console.log(team, players, team2);

    // 11. or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // 12. or use the new ES6 Spread
    // Spreads the old array into a new one
    const team4 =[...players];

    // 13. now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[2] ='Not at all Bruno';
    console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4);

    // 14. The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // 15. with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // 16. and think we make a copy:
    // Reference person variable
    const captain = person;
    // Reassigns number to both captain & person
    captain.number = 99;

    // 17. how do we take a copy instead?
    // Assignment Object.assign({}, source, {key-value to be changed})
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // 18. We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // 19. Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
